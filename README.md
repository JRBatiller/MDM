Mathematical Data Modelling

Melvy, Longxin, Yaniv, and I were given the task to optimise a royal mail national distribution centre (NDC). We were given a dataset containing a years worth of truck deliveries that deliver mail to and from the NDC. It was up to us to clean up and understand the data and also propose a new gate assignment that will make mail travel through the NDC more efficient. 

We chose to minimize the distance travelled of parcels within the NDC. We estimated the gate distances from the floor plan, got the volume of mail influx/outflux from the dataset and created shuffle.py, a python code to assign the gates as necessary.

edit: NDC dataset removed due to data privacy
